This group was composed of the parish clerks of London, who were in charge of registering those within the area of their assigned parish, as well as tracking the weekly burials and causes of death for their parish to be reported in the 'Bills of Mortality. These 'bills' began to be published inconsistently during the late 16th century, featuring a list of all parishes in and surrounding the city of London at the given time; beside each parish,  there was a count stating the total number of burials that week and how many of those burials were due to a death caused by the plague provided by the appointed clerk of each parish. It was around 1629 when an additional page was attached to the bills, which featured categories of disease and the total count of those who died from the specified diseases across all parishes, which led to the finalized form of the bills found in ",Object(u.jsx)("em",{children:"London's Dreadful Visitation"}),"."]}),Object(u.jsx)("p",{children:"In the 17th century printing was heavily controlled by the ruling monarchy in fear of the dissemination of negative press, but the work of the Company of Parish-Clerks was seen as a valuable service to the public, thus they were authorized to use the printing press.

These searchers discussed by both men were often poor, elderly women who were sent in pairs into the homes of the recently deceased members of their parish to diagnose the cause of death. These women were often forced into this line of work due to the idea that they were expendable, as they had nothing positive to give to their community-- widowed and left with no family to support them, they relied on a pension from the church to survive which they could lose should they refuse to work.

As class was increasingly taking shape in 17th century London, the economic status of the searchers also became a testament to the validity of the numbers they provided. Since the women who were searchers were often poor, it was believed that they could easily be bribed by those with higher status to diagnose the deceased with a disease seen as more favourable than something like the plague. This idea was further built upon by common beliefs held by wealthier members of society that those who were poor were often lazy and prone to malice; thus, the work of the searchers was even more untrustworthy due to the notion that they may simply misdiagnose disease and alter death counts for no other reason than to damage the reputation of the parish they oversaw.']}),Object(u.jsx)("p",{children:"This suspicion of a searcher's words also carried over into a suspicion of their very presence.

Despite searchers being untrained in formal medicine, they often did take their role seriously in attempting to determine accurate causes of death. If it was discovered that they accepted a bribed to misattribute a cause of death, they risked having their entire pension taken away from them, so, despite the popular notion that they were prone to bribery and laziness, the risk of extortion often outweighed the benefits of it.

Often through bribery from a wealthy family or as a favour to them to increase his social mobility and status, a parish clerk would mark in his notes that the deceased of these families should be buried in the churchyard or area designated for non-plague burials.

The outer parishes divided from those of the city were typically composed of working-class individuals who were pushed out of the more affluent areas of central London, and thus these rapidly growing areas became associated with crime and disease. This identity was further exacerbated by systems of public charity and relief within London's parishes, as the parishes within the walls maintained a well-organized exchanged between rich and poor parishes, while these newly establishing outer parishes relied only on their own, few resources, leading to a much lower standard of living."}),Object(u.jsx)("p",{children:"Thus, the combination of living conditions found in these less wealthy areas coupled with the deceptive reporting of mortality by a number of parish clerks led to the first cases of the plague appearing in the section of the Bills set aside for the parishes along the outer walls of London, which is also reflected in the map visualising this data above.

The plague then continues to disappear and reappear from the map in the same location up until the 20th week, May 2 to the 9th, when the plague begins to spread to the parishes east of St Giles in the Fields. Despite common belief that the bubonic plague was often imported into London due to the significance of its many dockyards along the Thames, yet since the 1665 plague outbreak had seemingly begun in a parish located away from any sites of importation, this indicated that it derived from disease that had already been living in London, but lying dormant until the perfect conditions for it to spread developed."]}),Object(u.jsx)("p",{children:"This pattern of development reinforced the notion for those of status or who sought higher status that plague was in fact, a symptom of poverty, thus the plague gained a stigma for marking one as lesser-- meaning that everything possible was done to avoid this label.

The wealthiest had additional properties in the more rural outer parishes that they would move to during times of increased plague mortality in the parish of their primary residences. This movement from in and out of the central walls of London is visible; beginning in week 25 when plague mortality begins its increase centrally, as you move the slider forward in time you can see the decrease of plague mortality centrally but a contrasting jump in plague mortality in the outer parishes where the wealthy fled to and took plague with them.

When looking at the source document itself, in the spring months when the plague had just begun appearing in a capacity beyond zero in the bills, the list of other possible causes of death grew. Between the 31st and 42nd week of the year, as the stream graph indicates there is a marked jump in the casualties caused by fever, spotted fever, and consumption. Spotted fever was occasionally noted as being difficult to distinguish from earlier stages of the plague, and fever could simply be a symptom of the plague, so although these marked surges could simply be misdiagnosed by searchers, they may also represent the redistribution and concealment of plague deaths that the wealth requested from their parish clerks to maintain their status, avoiding the negative reputation that they could garner should others know that the plague had affected their household."})]})]}),Object(u.jsxs)("section",{id:"bib",children:[Object(u.jsx)("h2",{id:"acknowledgements-bibliography",children:"Acknowledgements & Bibliography"}),Object(u.jsx)("p",{children:"I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Justin Colson from the University of Essex for aiding me in my pursuit of parish map data, as well as sharing additional resources I would have likely not found on my own."}),Object(u.jsxs)("p",{children:["I would also like to thank Dr. Matthew Davies and Dr Stephen Gadd from the ",Object(u.jsxs)("a",{href:"https://www.layersoflondon.org/",children:[Object(u.jsx)("em",{children:"Layers of London"})," project"]})," who generously shared the various shapefiles needed to create the map I made for this site representing 1665 London."]}),Object(u.jsx)("p",{children:"Finally, I, of course, would like to thank my professor for the course which this project was made for, Dr. Lori Jones, for her extensive feedback and excellent teaching throughout this semester that allowed this project to take its final form."}),Object(u.jsx)("h3",{children:"Data"}),Object(u.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(u.jsx)("b",{children:"Note:"})," All data and notes on data processing for this project can be located ",Object(u.jsx)("a",{href:"https://github.com/ChantalMB/HIST3907-dreadful-visitation",children:"here"}),", and the repository for this website is ",Object(u.jsx)("a",{href:"https://github.com/ChantalMB/dreadful-visitation-site",children:"here"}),"."]}),Object(u.jsxs)("p",{children:["Burton, N., Southall, H.
